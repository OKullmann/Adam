\subsection{Graph Colouring}
\begin{mydef}
In graph computational theory the graph colouring problem is a special assignment of which is traditionally assigned with colours. In the more common approach of the graph colouring problem is a way of colouring the vertices of an undirected graph such that no two adjacent vertices share the same colour.
\end{mydef}

There are two fundamental steps with the graph colouring process. The first is the decision process which we input a graph $\emph{G}$ with $\emph{n}$ vertices and choose an integer $\emph{K}$ where the graph colouring problem decision in yes. The example of the first case where the decision would be NP-complete would be the 3 colouring as shown below.

\end{center}

The output of the decision would be whether or not the graph $\emph{G}$ admits a proper vertex colouring with $\emph{k}$ colours. There is also a special case where a graph is 2 colourable and can be be done in $\emph{P}$ (Polynomial-time) and this is were the particular graph that we're colouring is bipartite which is a particular graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets were every edge that connects a vertex in $\emph{U}$ to one in $\emph{V}$.

The next step with graph colouring would be the optimisation which the chromatic number. The chromatic number refers to the smallest number of colours needed to colour a graph $\emph{G}$ is called the chromatic number and is often denoted by $\emph{X}$($\emph{G}$). With the optimisation process we will have an input of a graph $\emph{G}$ with $\emph{n}$ vertices. We will firstly have a look at the simplest form which is not bipartite. We have looked at this previously which is the triangle $\emph{K}$$^{3}$.

\vspace{3mm}
The first example that I will show is that a complete graph $\emph{K}$$^{3}$ with $\emph{n}$ vertices is $\emph{n}$-colourable but not (n-1) colourable. This is shown below showing that $\emph{K}$$^{3}$ is not 2 colourable. Another rule we would have to follow would be that $\emph{K}$$_{n}$ has a vertex set $\lbrace$1,...,n$\rbrace$ and all possible $\frac{1}{2}$ $\emph{n}$ ($\emph{n}$-1) edges. I will look at another example to prove the chromatic number which will be the graph $\emph{K}$$_{4}$ with 4 vertices is 4 colourable as shown below:

\end{center}

\vspace{3mm}
On the other hand the same graph will not be $\emph{n}$-1 colourable (4-1 = 3 colourable). The graph above proves it's not 3 colourable as well as showig the graphs has the correct number of edges for a $\emph{K}$$_{4}$ graph. $\frac{1}{2}$ $\emph{n}$ ($\emph{n}$-1) edges = 2(3) = 6.

\subsection{SAT}

\begin{mydef}
An instance of SAT is a Boolean formula composed of $\emph{n}$ Boolean variables such as $\emph{X}$$_{1}$,$\emph{X}$$_{2}$,..., $\emph{X}$$_{n}$; and $\emph{m}$ Boolean connectives any Boolean function with one or two inputs and one output, such as $\bigwedge$ (AND), $\bigvee$ (OR), $\neg$ (NOT), $\rightarrow$ (implication), $\leftrightarrow$ (if and only if); and Parentheses (Without loss of generality, we assume that there are no redundant parentheses, i.e. there is at mose one pair of parentheses per Boolean connective).
\end{mydef}

As an example, I will show it with the following formula:

$\phi$ = (($\emph{x}$$_{1}$ $\rightarrow$ $\emph{x}$$_{2}$) $\bigvee$ $\neg$ (($\emph{x}$$_{1}$ $\leftrightarrow$ $\emph{x}$$_{3}$) $\bigvee$ $\emph{x}$$_{4}$)) $\bigwedge$ $\neg$ $\emph{x}$$_{4}$


Has the satisfying assignment $<$$\emph{x}$$_{1}$ = 0, $\emph{x}$$_{2}$ = 0, $\emph{x}$$_{3}$ = 1 and $\emph{x}$$_{4}$ = 1$>$

= ((0 $\rightarrow$ 0) $\bigvee$ $\neg$(($\neg$0 $\leftrightarrow$ 1) $\bigvee$ 1)) $\bigwedge$ $\neg$0

= (1 $\bigvee$ $\neg$(1 $\bigvee$ 1)) $\bigwedge$ 1

= (1 $\bigvee$ 0) $\bigwedge$ 1

= 1


This shows that the following formula $\phi$ belongs to SAT [1].
